# CSharpTutorial

Learning the basics or fundamentals of C# in December/January.  The final goal is to code a functional CRUD app based on the skills I
learn in the next 3-6 weeks.

# Notes :

- I like the syntax of C#.  Its easy to read and understand.  Very similiar to Javascript in structure.
- Curious how many different applications you can create using C# and .NET.
- After recent meetup, most employed developers were working with C#, .NET and SQL.
